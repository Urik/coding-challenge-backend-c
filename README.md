# Busbud Coding Challenge [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/busbud/coding-challenge-backend-c/tree/master.png?circle-token=6e396821f666083bc7af117113bdf3a67523b2fd)](https://circleci.com/gh/busbud/coding-challenge-backend-c)

## Requirements

Design an API endpoint that provides auto-complete suggestions for large cities.
The suggestions should be restricted to cities in the USA and Canada with a population above 5000 people.

- the endpoint is exposed at `/suggestions`
- the partial (or complete) search term is passed as a querystring parameter `q`
- the caller's location can optionally be supplied via querystring parameters `latitude` and `longitude` to help improve relative scores
- the endpoint returns a JSON response with an array of scored suggested matches
    - the suggestions are sorted by descending score
    - each suggestion has a score between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating confidence in the suggestion (1 is most confident)
    - each suggestion has a name which can be used to disambiguate between similarly named locations
    - each suggestion has a latitude and longitude
- all functional tests should pass (additional tests may be implemented as necessary).
- the final application should be [deployed to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).
- feel free to add more features if you like!

#### Sample responses

These responses are meant to provide guidance. The exact values can vary based on the data source and scoring algorithm

**Near match**

    GET /suggestions?q=Londo&latitude=43.70011&longitude=-79.4163

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "name": "London, ON, Canada",
      "latitude": "42.98339",
      "longitude": "-81.23304",
      "score": 0.9
    },
    {
      "name": "London, OH, USA",
      "latitude": "39.88645",
      "longitude": "-83.44825",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "name": "London, KY, USA",
      "latitude": "37.12898",
      "longitude": "-84.08326",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "name": "Londontowne, MD, USA",
      "latitude": "38.93345",
      "longitude": "-76.54941",
      "score": 0.3
    }
  ]
}
```

**No match**

    GET /suggestions?q=SomeRandomCityInTheMiddleOfNowhere

```json
{
  "suggestions": []
}
```


### Non-functional

- All code should be written in Javascript
- Mitigations to handle high levels of traffic should be implemented
- Challenge is submitted as pull request against this repo ([fork it](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)).
- Documentation and maintainability is a plus

- Geonames provides city lists Canada and the USA http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt

## Getting Started

Begin by forking this repo and cloning your fork. GitHub has apps for [Mac](http://mac.github.com/) and
[Windows](http://windows.github.com/) that make this easier.

### Setting up a Nodejs environment

Get started by installing [nodejs](http://www.nodejs.org).

For OS X users, use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and `brew install nvm`

Once that's done, from the project directory, run

```
nvm use
```

### Setting up the project

In the project directory run

```
npm install
```

### Running the tests

The test suite can be run with

```
npm test
```

### Starting the application

To start a local server run

```
PORT=3456 npm start
```

which should produce output similar to

```
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3456/suggestions
```

# Development notes

The application works by preloading and filtering the cities data file in memory, which is not wrong given its low size of 1 MB. If the file was bigger, we could use a database or text search tool instead, but for simplicity reasons I chose not to.

In order to handle the text search, I'm using the library FuseJS, which provides fuzzy searching features. It'll search the objects, handle typos and similar names, and multi field searches easily. 
Another big feature that led me to choosing it is that it'll add a score based on how close the name is to the search term, making it easy to compute a query score afterwards.

In order to handle the geolocation assisted search I chose to first narrow down the search for performance reasons using the name. Afterwards I'll compute the distance to each result, and then normalize the distances to a value between 0 and 1.
Afterwards, computing the overall score is a matter of doing a weighted average calculation between the name score and the distance score. 
After some experimentation, I decided to give a 0.6 value of weight to the distance, and 0.4 value of weight to the name.

I also decided to reject queries without any text, returning an HTTP error code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity).
The code is deployed in Heroku:
